This allows mappers to use any Quake compatible model, sprite or BSP as a key. We’ve also included new key models with different variations. You can find these in the progs folder and set their paths in the mdl key.

keyname: name of the key, e.g. 'bronze key' (required), mdl: model file path (required) noise: sound file for the pickup sound (default is per worldtype), skin: skin index (default 0), frame (default 0): display this single frame of the model, if animated. NOTE: The key will not display any animation.

Three new models based on id’s original keys are included. One for each worldtype: base, runic and wizard. Each of these has four color variations, also referred to as their skin index: jade (green, skin 0), runic (magenta, skin 1), blood (red, skin 2) and alabaster (gray, skin 3). The development/wads folder has a small wad with textures for use with the different styles seen below.

'keyname': name of the key, e.g. 'bronze key' (required)

'mdl': model file (required)

'noise': sound file for the pickup sound (default is per worldtype)

'skin': skin index (default 0)

The 'keyname' value is used both for the pickup message and to associate the key with the entity that it unlocks.

To make a func_door or trigger_usekey require this key, set the 'keyname' value of that entity so that it matches the 'keyname' value of the key.

If different item_key_custom entities have the same 'keyname' value, they will be treated as different copies of the same key and may be used interchangeably.

A map may have a maximum of 23 unique 'keyname' values across all entities.

The behavior of an item_key_custom should be as the player expects (based on the behavior of the silver and gold keys), except for the fact that it will not appear as an icon in the player's status bar when picked up.  This is a limitation of the engine."

You have various ways of setting the door's movement:
- using the traditional 'angle'/'lip' keys
- using 'angle', but with 'distance' instead of lip, to specify a travel distance directly
- setting 'movedir' as a direct x/y/z distance vector relative to its initial position
- setting 'mangle' and 'distance' to make it move in a specific angle and linear distance

Note that those methods are mutually exclusive, so if you use one of those, remember to remove the keys relative to the others, or else you might have some unexpected behaviour.

Other new features:

A custom key can be added through the 'keyname' field. See the 'item_key_custom' entity for more details.

You can set delayed movement for a door part with the 'delay' key. The timings are automatically reverted when closing, which means that the first part to open will be the last to close.

Doors can have different opening and closing speeds.

You have the option to link different door entities through the 'groupname' key, whether they're touching or not. Useful to create a multi-part door. Setting a groupname on a door ignores the usual touching check, and will only link if they have the same groupname.

You can set the sound of the door to play during only that door's movement, or for the whole linked door animaton (spawnflag 'Sound during delay'). Also you can set custom sounds with 'noise1' to 'noise4'.

You're not required to set 'Don't link' on toggling doors anymore (yay!).

You can force a door to be crushing regardless of its 'wait' value, with the spawnflag 'Crushing'.

The door now has built-in support for switchable shadows, that fade in/out automatically as the door moves. Setting '_switchableshadow' to 1 should be enough.

Proximity

Default mode. The closer the player gets, the more visible the brush becomes, and vice versa.
'waitmin' sets the inner fade distance - in other words, if the player gets closer than that the brush will be totally visible. 'waitmax' on the other hand defines the maximum distance before the brush fades away completely.

You can invert the close/far fading behavior with the 'Reverse' spawnflag, so the brush will disappear as the player gets closer.

The 'target' field can point to an entity to acts as custom origin to check for player proximity. An info_notnull point entity can be used as target. If 'target' is unset (or no entity is found under that name), the origin's coordinate will be the brush's midpoint.

---------------------------------------
Trigger

When given a targetname, it'll operate in trigger mode. Just target the func_fade entity to toggle it on/off. The fade time can be changed through the 'speed' key.

It can be set to start visible through the 'Start on' spawnflag.

Use path_corner as targets.
path_corners with a 'wait -1' value will stop the train. Trigger the func_train again to resume its path.

'pausetime' sets a default waiting time when a value is not defined in path_corners.
'speed' sets the initial moving speed. If the train encounters a path_corner with its 'speed' field set it will move at that speed afterwards.

misc_modeltrain smoothly orients itself towards the next path_corner when moving. The turning speed is automatic and based on the movement speed, but you can set a multiplier for the turning speed with the 'multiplier' key. Set it to -1 to turn instantly.

You can define two different frame ranges and animation speeds, for when the model is stopped and moving. If you don't need different stopped/moving animations, only setting 'first_frame'/'last_frame'/'frtime' is enough. If you don't need any animation at all, just set 'first_frame' to the desired frame and all other fields can go blank.

If you want to explicitly set frame 0 in any frame fields, you must use -1 instead, or else the code understands 0 as a blank field.


Spawnflags:
- No rotation: model doesn't rotate when moving towards path_corners.
- Rotate Y only: model only rotates around the Y axis, so pitch/roll angles are kept as initially set.

Enhanced Plat

--------------
'Plat Start at Top' is a plat that starts at the top and when triggered, goes down, waits, then comes back up.
health - number of seconds to wait (default 5)
--------------
'Plat Toggle' is a plat that will change between the top and bottom each time it is triggered.
--------------
'Elevator' is an elevator plat. You can have as many levels as you want but they must be all the same distance away. Use elevator button entity as the trigger. Each floor must have its own panel with func_elvtr_buttons for the elevator to move correctly.

cnt is the number of floors
height is the distance between floors
wait is the number of seconds before the elevator can be activated again after starting or stopping (default 0)

'Elevator Start at Top' is an optional flag for elevators. It just tells the elevator that it's position is the top floor. (Default is the bottom floor) USE THIS ONLY WITH ELEVATORS!
-------------
'Plat2' is a fixed version of the original plat. If you want the plat to start at the bottom and move to the top on demand, use a negative height. That will tell Quake to lower the plat at spawn time. Always place this plat type in the top position when making the map. This will ensure correct lighting, hopefully. If a plat2 is the target of a trigger, it will be disabled until it has been triggered. Delay is the wait before the plat returns to original position.

If you don't want to bother figuring out the height, don't put a
value in the height

For the 'random' mode, however, the 'count' field isn't necessary, since destination ordering doesn't matter in this case.

Ultimate scripting ability. You can test various fields on the entity targeted by the 'include' field (you can target another entity's 'targetname2' as well). If you let the 'include' field empty, it'll test against the activating entity, be it the player, a monster or anything else - see trigger_everything for more details.

You can, for example, relay a trigger only if a door or plat is in a certain position, or if a targeted enemy is alive/dead, or below a certain health amount, or if the player is carrying some specific weapon or item - the possibilites are almost endless.

In case you're filtering to activate only in case if it's a specific weapon projectile (like a grenade), you can make the targets fire with the activating entity's owner as the activator - say, if the trigger is activated by a player's grenade, it'll fire with the player as activator.

There are various fields available to test, selectable through the 'style' key. They all fall into three field types (float, flag and string), and for each there's a set of operations available to evaluate, selectable through the 'weapon' key.
- Float types can do all operations, and are compared to this entity's 'count' field.
- Flag types support Equal and bitwise AND, and are compared to the 'aflag' field.
- String types have only Equal evaluation, and are compared to this entity's 'type' field.

You can set the trigger to fire if the condition evaluates to false by activating the spawnflag 'Trigger if false'. It'll never fire if the entity targeted by 'include' isn't found, regardless of this spawnflag.

If you need to evaluate more than one condition, you can chain multiple filters in a row.
Also, the state of the last evaluation is stored in this entity's 'state' field (1 for fired, 0 for not fired).

Select the desired mapvar id using the 'count' field, and the value to be set in 'style'. You can either set to on, set to off, or toggle the flag's value.

Mapvars are miscellaneous flags (only true/false values) that can be freely used by the mapper whose values persist across level changes. Useful to track completion progress on mapjams for example. You have a total of 44 flags availabe to use, each identified by a number in the 1-44 range.
