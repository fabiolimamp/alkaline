# Alkaline
The ultimate Quake 1 Base modâ€¦ until something better comes along.

## Compiling

Latest version of FTEQCC is recommended for compiling. Both a progs.dat and a csprogs.dat file should be generated, for server-side and client-side QC, respectively.

Sourceports with no CSQC support will just ignore csprogs.dat and work just the same with a non-expanded HUD.



## Assets

Mod assets (such as sounds and models) aren't included in this repository and should be downloaded separately.
